Iraq Databank is a repository for data and resources related to Iraq. Useful for writers, researchers and analysts.

The website is available in English and Arabic and includes simple search functionality.

Developed using React and with Semantic UI for styling.

An intresting part of this project was using a tree structure to organise the files and then parsing that structure to render it on the page.
